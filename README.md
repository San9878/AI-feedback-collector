# what it does

- **receives prompts and ai-generated responses**  
- **allows human reviewers to rate and comment on the output**  
- **stores the data securely in a remote supabase database**  
- **exposes clean, restful endpoints to submit and retrieve feedback**

# technologies used

- `fastapi` for the backend  
- `supabase` (postgresql + rest api) for cloud database  
- `pydantic` for data validation  
- `.env` for secret management

# why it matters

this project demonstrates my ability to:

- build production-ready apis  
- integrate third-party cloud services  
- work with databases in a clean, scalable way  
- contribute to real-world ai workflows (model evaluation, rlhf, prompt engineering)
